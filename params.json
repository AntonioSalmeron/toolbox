{"name":"AMIDST Toolbox","tagline":"Analysis of MassIve Data STreams using Probabilistic Graphical Models","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis toolbox offers a collection of scalable and parallel algorithms for inference and learning of hybrid Bayesian networks from streaming data. For example, AMIDST provides parallel multi-core implementations for Bayesian parameter learning, using streaming variational Bayes and variational message passing. Additionally, AMIDST efficiently leverages existing functionalities and algorithms by interfacing to existing software tools such as R, Weka, HUGIN and MOA. AMIDST is an open source toolbox written in Java and is available under the Apache Software License.\r\n\r\n![EU Logo](https://github.com/amidst/core/blob/master/doc/presentations/EU-logo.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nAnalysis of data streams using expressive and flexible Bayesian networks\r\n\r\nThis is the repository for the open source code in the AMIDST project.\r\n\r\nInstall Java 8 and IntelliJ:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/\r\n\r\nIn IntelliJ open the maven project by pointint at the pom file. Also you need to point to the Java 8 installation and you are ready to rock.\r\n\r\n# Compiling & Running from the command line\r\n\r\n1- Install Maven: http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi\r\n(Download binaries and copy to Applications folder)\r\n\r\n2- Modify the file maven_startup.sh (which you can find in the root project folder) and fix the path of your maven (Line 5) and java installation (Line 9).\r\n\r\n3- Create (or modify if already exists) a file \".profile\" or \".bash_profile\" in you home directory and add the following line,\r\nwhich points to file \"maven_startup.sh\"\r\n\r\n        source <project-folder>/maven_startup.sh\r\n\r\n Now after restarting the terminal, mvn should work.\r\n\r\n\r\n4- The script \"compile.sh\" (which you can find in the root project folder) just compiles the whole project.\r\n\r\n\r\n5- The script \"run.sh\" (which you can find in the root project folder) should be used to run some class. For example,\r\n\r\n        ./run.sh eu.amidst.core.examples.learning.ParallelMaximumLikelihoodExample","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
