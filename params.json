For example, AMIDST provides parallel multi-core implementations for Bayesian parameter learning, using streaming variational Bayes and variational message passing. Additionally, AMIDST efficiently leverages existing functionalities and algorithms by interfacing to existing software tools such as R, Weka, HUGIN and MOA. AMIDST is an open source toolbox written in Java and is available under the Apache Software License.\r\n\r\nIn the next figure we show a taxonomy of relevant data mining tools dealing with PGMs and data streams. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other software for mining data streams based on PGMs, most of the existing softwares based on PGMs are only focused on mining stationary data sets. Hence, the main goal of AMIDST is to fill this gap and produce a significant contribution within the areas of PGMs and mining streaming data.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img title=\"Taxonomy\" src=\"https://github.com/amidst/toolbox/blob/master/doc/Taxonomy.png?raw=true\" width=\"400\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Scalability\r\n\r\nScalability is a main concern for the AMIDST toolbox. As mentioned before, we exploit Java 8 functional programming style to provide parallel implementations of most of our algorithms. If more computation capacity is needed to process data streams, AMIDST users can also use more CPU cores. As an example, the following figure shows how the data processing capacity of our toolbox increases with the number of cores when learning a hybrid BN model with latent variables using the AMIDST's learning engine. More precisely we learn a PGM model with multinomial (blue nodes) and Gaussian (green nodes) variables, some of them are latent, non observable, variables (dashed nodes). As can be seen, using our variational learning engine AMIDST toolbox is able to process data in the order of gigabytes per hour depending on the number of available cores with large and complex PGMs with latent variables.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/amidst/toolbox/blob/master/doc/Scalability.png?raw=true\" width=\"800\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n1.

AMIDST provides a collection of functionalities and algorithms for learning hybrid Bayesian networks from streaming data. In what follows, we describe the main functionalities that AMIDST toolbox supplies.\r\n\r\n###Data Streams<a name=\"datastreams\"></a> \r\nAMIDST provides parallel processing built-in functionalities for dealing with streaming data \\citep{CIM2015}. It is possible to make several passes over the data samples if the stream can be stored on disk, otherwise the samples are discarded after being processed. The data format supported by AMIDST is Weka's ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) \\citep{Hall2009}.\r\n\r\n###Probabilistic Graphical Models<a name=\"pgms\"></a>\r\nAMIDST currently includes efficient implementations for representing Bayesian networks. AMIDST supports both discrete and continuous variables, and besides Multionomial, Gaussian and conditional linear Gaussian distributions, it also supports other distributions such as Gamma, Poission, Dirichlet, etc. as far as the final BN can be represented as a \\textit{conjugate-exponential family model} \\citep{WinnBishop2005}.  Other kind of probabilistic graphical models, such as dynamic BNs, are expected to be included in this toolbox.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Inference Engine<a name=\"inference\"></a>\r\nAMIDST includes the implementation of the \\textit{variational message passing} \\citep{WinnBishop2005} algorithm, and the parallel implementation of the \\textit{importance sampling} \\citep{hammersley1964monte,CAEPIA2015} algorithm. It also supports exact inference by interfacing with Hugin's junction tree inference algorithm \\citep{Madsen2005Hugin}. \r\n\r\n\r\n###Learning Engine<a name=\"learning\"></a>  \r\nIn AMIDST, a fully Bayesian approach is pursued, which means that the parameter learning reduces to the task of inference. AMIDST provides a multi-core parallel implementation of the \\textit{streaming variational Bayes} algorithm \\citep{broderick2013streaming}, using \\textit{variational message passing} as underlying inference engine, which can deal with large models with latent variables. When the model does not contain latent variables, an efficient parallel implementation of \\textit{maximum likelihood estimation} \\citep{mlestimation} can be also used by exploiting an efficient vector-based representation of BNs as \\textit{exponential family models} \\citep{WinnBishop2005}. For structural learning, AMIDST currently supports standard PC and parallel TAN algorithms by interfacing with HUGIN \\citep{Madsen2005Hugin,Madsen2014}.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Concept drift<a name=\"conceptdrift\"></a> \r\nAMIDST also offers some support for dealing with concept drift while learning BNs from data streams. Firstly, we provide an extension of the \\textit{streaming variational Bayes} algorithm \\citep{broderick2013streaming} which exponentially down-weights the influence of \\textit{old} data samples with the use of a fading factor (TODO). So, models learnt with this approach will be \\textit{focused} in most recent data. In addition, AMIDST provides a probabilistic concept drift detector based on the use of latent variables \\citep{IDA2015}.\r\n\r\n###Library Links<a name=\"librarylinks\"></a> \r\nAMIDST leverages existing functionalities and algorithms by interfacing to existing software tools such as R, Weka, HUGIN and MOA (Massive Online Analysis) \\citep{BifetHolmesKirkbyPfahringer10}. This allows to efficiently well established systems and also broaden the AMIDST user-base. \r\n\r\n* **HuginLink** module consists of a set of functionalities implemented to link the AMIDST toolbox with the HUGIN software \\citep{Madsen2005Hugin}. This connection extends AMIDST by providing the main functionalities integrated in Hugin software, such as exact inference algorithms and scalable structural learning algorithms \\citep{Madsen2014}. \r\n\r\n* **MoaLink** module ensures an easy use of AMDIST functionalities within MOA \\citep{BifetHolmesKirkbyPfahringer10}.  The main idea is that any model deployed in AMIDST can be integrated and evaluated using MOA's graphical user interface. As a proof of concept, \\textit{MoaLink} already provides a classification, a regression and a clustering method based on BN models with latent variables. These models are learnt in a streaming fashion using AMIDST learning engine. \r\n\r\n* **RLink** module ....\r\n\r\n## Code Examples<a name=\"examples\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation<a name=\"installation\"></a>\r\n\r\nInstall Java 8 and IntelliJ:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/\r\n\r\nIn IntelliJ open the maven project by pointint at the pom file. Also you need to point to the Java 8 installation and you are ready to rock.\r\n\r\n### Compiling & Running from the command line<a name=\"compiling\"></a>\r\n\r\n1. Install Maven: http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi\r\n(Download binaries and copy to Applications folder)\r\n\r\n2. Modify the file maven_startup.sh (which you can find in the root project folder) and fix the path of your maven (Line 5) and java installation (Line 9).\r\n\r\n3. Create (or modify if already exists) a file \".profile\" or \".bash_profile\" in you home directory and add the following line,\r\nwhich points to file \"maven_startup.sh\"\r\n\r\n        source <project-folder>/maven_startup.sh\r\n\r\n Now after restarting the terminal, mvn should work.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The script \"compile.sh\" (which you can find in the root project folder) just compiles the whole project.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The script \"run.sh\" (which you can find in the root project folder) should be used to run some class. For example,\r\n\r\n        ./run.sh eu.amidst.core.examples.learning.ParallelMaximumLikelihoodExample","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
