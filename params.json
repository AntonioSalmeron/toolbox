{"name":"AMIDST Toolbox 1.0","tagline":"A Java Library for Analysis of MassIve Data Streams using Probabilistic Graphical Models","body":"# Scope\r\n\r\nThis toolbox offers a collection of scalable and parallel algorithms for inference and learning of hybrid Bayesian \r\nnetworks from streaming data. For example, AMIDST provides parallel multi-core implementations of Bayesian parameter \r\nlearning, using streaming variational Bayes and variational message passing. Additionally, AMIDST efficiently leverages \r\nexisting functionalities and algorithms by interfacing to existing software tools such as [Hugin](http://www.hugin.com) \r\nand [MOA](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz). AMIDST is an open source toolbox written in Java and is available under the \r\nApache Software License 2.0.\r\n\r\nIn the next figure we show a taxonomy of relevant data mining tools dealing with PGMs and data streams. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other software for mining data streams based on PGMs, most of the existing softwares based on PGMs are only focused on mining stationary data sets. Hence, the main goal of AMIDST is to fill this gap and produce a significant contribution within the areas of PGMs and mining streaming data.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img title=\"Taxonomy\" src=\"https://amidst.github.io/toolbox/docs/taxonomy.pdf\" width=\"500\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n# Scalability\r\n\r\nScalability is a main concern for the AMIDST toolbox. We exploit Java 8 functional \r\nprogramming style to provide parallel implementations of most of our algorithms. If more computation capacity \r\nis needed to process data streams, AMIDST users can also use more CPU cores. As an example, the following \r\nfigure shows how the data processing capacity of our toolbox increases with the number of cores when learning \r\na hybrid BN model with latent variables using the AMIDST's learning engine. More precisely, we learn a PGM model \r\nwith multinomial (blue nodes) and Gaussian (green nodes) variables, some of them are latent, non observable, \r\nvariables (dashed nodes). As can be seen, using our variational learning engine AMIDST toolbox is able to \r\nprocess data in the order of gigabytes per hour depending on the number of available cores with large and \r\ncomplex PGMs with latent variables[^1].\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://amidst.github.io/toolbox/docs/scalability.pdf\" width=\"800\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation<a name=\"documentation\"></a>\r\n\r\nClick in some of following links for further information:\r\n\r\n* [Getting Started](http://amidst.github.io/toolbox/GettingStarted.html) describes how to install the toolbox, how this toolbox integrates with Java 8 new functional-style programming features, and why it is based on a module based architecture.\r\n\r\n* [Toolbox Functionalities](http://amidst.github.io/toolbox/ToolboxFunctionalities.html) describes which are the main functionalities (i.e. pgms, learning and inference algorithms, etc) included in the current version of the toolbox.\r\n\r\n* [Contributing to AMIDST](http://amidst.github.io/toolbox/ContributingToAMIDST.html) describes the steps needed to contribute to this toolbox.
